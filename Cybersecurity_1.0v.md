## The Need for Cybersecurity

The connected electronic information network has become an integral part of our daily lives. 
All types of organizations, such as medical, financial, and education institutions, 
use this network to operate effectively. 
They utilize the network by collecting, processing, storing, and sharing vast amounts of digital information.
As more digital information is gathered and shared, the protection of this information is becoming 
even more vital to our national security and economic stability.
Cybersecurity is the ongoing effort to protect these networked systems and all
of the data from unauthorized use or harm. 
On a personal level, you need to safeguard your identity, your data, and your computing devices. 
At the corporate level, it is everyone’s responsibility to protect the organization’s reputation, 
data, and customers. 
At the state level, national security, and the safety and well-being of the citizens are at stake.

## Offline and online identity

As more time is spent online, your identity, both online and offline, can affect your life. 
Your offline identity is the person who your friends and family interact with on a daily basis at home, 
at school, or work. They know your personal information, such as your name, age, or where you live. 
Your online identity is who you are in cyberspace. 
Your online identity is how you present yourself to others online. 
This online identity should only reveal a limited amount of information about you.
You should take care when choosing a username or alias for your online identity. 
The username should not include any personal information. 
It should be something appropriate and respectful. 
This username should not lead strangers to think you are an easy target for cybercrimes or unwanted attention.
