# Lab â€“ What was Taken?

### Objectives 
Search for and read about a few recent occurrences of security breaches.

### Background / Scenario
Security breaches occur when individuals or applications are trying to gain unauthorized access to data, 
applications, services, or devices. During these breaches, the attackers, whether they are insiders or not, 
attempt to obtain information that they could use for financial gains or other advantages. In this lab, you will 
explore a few security breaches to determine what was taken, what exploits were used, and what you can do to protect yourself.

### Required Resources
* PC or mobile device with Internet access
